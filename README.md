## üöÄ Features
- **Single Player Mode:** Face off against an adaptive AI Bot with three difficulty levels. Each level not only increases the ball's speed but also the bot's prediction accuracy. Can you outsmart the machine?
- **Two Player Mode:** Go head-to-head with a friend! Both players can select the ball speed increase for a custom challenge.
- **Dynamic Physics:** Realistic paddle acceleration, friction, and ball spin for a fresh take on classic Pong.
- **Difficulty Customization:** Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard. In single player, difficulty affects both ball speed and bot intelligence. In two player, it controls only the ball speed.
- **Sleek UI:** Clean, readable menus and in-game overlays for a smooth experience.

## üéÆ Controls
- **Left Paddle:** W/S keys
- **Right Paddle:** Arrow keys (or AI Bot in single player)

## üß† AI Bot
The Bot isn't just fast‚Äîit predicts, adapts, and makes mistakes (sometimes). Each difficulty level changes both the ball's speed increase and the bot's accuracy:
- **Easy:** +10% speed/hit, 60% bot accuracy
- **Medium:** +25% speed/hit, 80% bot accuracy
- **Hard:** +50% speed/hit, 95% bot accuracy
