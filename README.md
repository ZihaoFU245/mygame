# Pong: The Ultimate Paddle Showdown

Welcome to **Pong**, a modern, physics-powered reimagining of the classic arcade game! Whether you want to challenge a friend or test your reflexes against a cunning AI, this game delivers fast-paced, competitive fun with a twist.

## 🚀 Features
- **Single Player Mode:** Face off against an adaptive AI Bot with three difficulty levels. Each level not only increases the ball's speed but also the bot's prediction accuracy. Can you outsmart the machine?
- **Two Player Mode:** Go head-to-head with a friend! Both players can select the ball speed increase for a custom challenge.
- **Dynamic Physics:** Realistic paddle acceleration, friction, and ball spin for a fresh take on classic Pong.
- **Difficulty Customization:** Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard. In single player, difficulty affects both ball speed and bot intelligence. In two player, it controls only the ball speed.
- **Sleek UI:** Clean, readable menus and in-game overlays for a smooth experience.

## 🎮 Controls
- **Left Paddle:** W/S keys
- **Right Paddle:** Arrow keys (or AI Bot in single player)
- **Menu Navigation:**
  - `1` — Single Player
  - `2` — Two Player
  - `1/2/3` — Select difficulty
  - `SPACE` — Start/Restart
  - `ESC` — Quit/Back

## 🧠 AI Bot
The Bot isn't just fast—it predicts, adapts, and makes mistakes (sometimes). Each difficulty level changes both the ball's speed increase and the bot's accuracy:
- **Easy:** +10% speed/hit, 60% bot accuracy
- **Medium:** +25% speed/hit, 80% bot accuracy
- **Hard:** +50% speed/hit, 95% bot accuracy

## 🏆 How to Win
First to 11 points takes the crown. But beware: the longer the rally, the faster the ball gets!

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and `pygame` installed.
2. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
3. Select your mode and difficulty. Paddle up!
